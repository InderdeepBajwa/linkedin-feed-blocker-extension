# LinkedIn Feed/News Blocker Chrome Extension

LinkedIn feeds are great but can be distracting in a professional environment. In order to create a focus-friendly environment, this extension removes the feed and news section from LinkedIn.

Download the [linkedin-feed-blocker-extension.crx](https://github.com/InderdeepBajwa/linkedin-feed-blocker-extension/releases) file and upload it to any Chromium-supported browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, etc.)
